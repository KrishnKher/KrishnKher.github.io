Greetings! <br>
My name is **Krishn**, and I am currently a second-year Ph. D student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vineeth N. Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/). In the previous epoch, I finished my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engineering, and Engineering Science at the same institute. My current research interests primarily concern memory, logical and computational requirements in modern deep learning architectures [[details](https://krishnkher.github.io/blog/2024/research-statement/), [pdf][https://drive.google.com/file/d/1auazoAEywyWf6M3V0iXtXcwhJhbhebCK/view?usp=sharing]], with an applied theoretical flavour (in the balance of probabilities, more theoretical!). I have longstanding interests in discrete math and theoretical computer science, but have also recently started dabbling with optimization in real spaces. <br>
For more information regarding my academic interests and work, you are graciously invited to glance at the other vistas here! My CV can be downloaded by clicking on the `PDF` button on the top-right of this page.
