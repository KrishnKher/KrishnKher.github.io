Greetings! 
My name is Krishn and I am currently second-year Ph. D student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Vineeth N. Balasubramanian] (https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/). In the previous epoch, I finished my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engineering, and Engineering Science at the same institute. My current research interests primarily concern memory, logical and computational requirements in modern deep learning architectures, with an applied theoretical flavour (in the balance of probabilities, more theoretical!). I have longstanding interests in discrete math and theoretical computer science, but have also recently started dabbling with optimization in real spaces. As a person, I delight in seeing the true nature of everything. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
