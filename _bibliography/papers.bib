  abstract     = {Bug-fix pattern detection has been investigated in the
past in the context of classical software. However, while
quantum software is developing rapidly, the literature is still
lacking automated methods and tools to identify, analyze,
and detect bug-fix patterns. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first to leverage classical techniques to detect bug-fix patterns in quantum code. In this paper, we propose an automated framework, called Q-Diff, for detecting
bug-fix patterns in IBM Qiskit quantum code. In the framework, we develop a proof-of-concept tool based on Abstract
Syntax Trees. To validate our method, we test Q-Diff with
a variety of quantum bug-fix patterns using examples. We
hope our work will attract the attention of the quantum
software engineering community to improve the quality of
quantum software.

  title={On Hierarchically Closed Fractional Intersecting Families},
  author={Balachandran, Niranjan and Bhattacharya, Srimanta and Kher†, Krishn and Mathew, Rogers and Sankarnarayanan, Brahadeesh},
  abstract={For a set \(L\) of positive proper fractions and a positive integer $$r \geq 2$$,
a fractional $$r$$-closed $$L$$-intersecting family is a collection $$F \subset P(\[n\])$$ with the
property that for any $$2 \leq t \leq r$$ and $$A_1, \ldots, A_t \in F$$ there exists $$\theta \in L$$ such that
$$|A_1 \cup \ldots \cup A_t| \in \{\theta|A_1|, \ldots, \theta|A_t|\}$$. In this paper we show that for $$r \geq 3$$ and
$$L = {\theta}$$ any fractional $$r$$-closed $$\theta$$-intersecting family has size at most linear in $$n$$,
and this is best possible up to a constant factor. We also show that in the case
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2}$$ we have a tight upper bound of $$\ceil{\frac{3n}{2}}-2$$ and that a maximal $$r$$-closed
$$(\frac{1}{2})$$-intersecting family is determined uniquely up to isomorphism.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
